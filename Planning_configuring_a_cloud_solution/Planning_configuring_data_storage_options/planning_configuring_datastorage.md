1. Product choice:

  Google Cloud offers several data storage products, each designed for specific types of data and use cases. 
  When selecting a data storage product, consider factors such as the type and volume of data being stored, 
  the required level of consistency, and the desired access patterns.

- Cloud SQL: Cloud SQL is a managed MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server database service. It provides a fully 
  managed database experience, with automated backups, replication, and scaling.

- BigQuery: BigQuery is a fully-managed data warehouse that allows you to store, query, and analyze large datasets.
  It provides a serverless experience and supports real-time streaming data.

- Firestore: Firestore is a NoSQL document database that provides real-time synchronization and offline support for 
  web and mobile applications. It provides a flexible data model and supports automatic scaling.

- Cloud Spanner: Cloud Spanner is a globally-distributed, horizontally-scalable database service that provides strong 
  consistency and high availability. It is designed for mission-critical applications that require low latency and high throughput.

- Cloud Bigtable: Cloud Bigtable is a NoSQL database service that provides real-time access to large datasets. 
  It is designed for applications that require high throughput and low latency.


2. Choosing storage options:

  Google Cloud offers several storage options for each data storage product, each designed for specific use cases and 
  access patterns. When choosing a storage option, consider factors such as the frequency and type of access, the required 
  level of durability and availability, and the desired cost.

- Zonal persistent disk: Zonal persistent disks are block storage volumes that are attached to a single virtual machine 
  instance in a specific zone. They provide low-latency access and high durability, and are ideal for high-performance 
  workloads that require low latency.

- Regional balanced persistent disk: Regional balanced persistent disks are block storage volumes that are replicated 
  across multiple zones within a region. They provide high availability and durability, and are ideal for workloads that 
  require geographic redundancy and high availability.

- Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive: These are object storage options offered by Google Cloud, with varying levels 
  of access time, durability, and cost. Standard storage is designed for frequently accessed data, while Nearline, 
  Coldline, and Archive are designed for infrequently accessed data with varying levels of access times and costs.
