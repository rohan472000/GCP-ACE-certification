Viewing audit logs is a task that involves reviewing and analyzing records of activity that have occurred within 
a Google Cloud environment. These logs provide detailed information about actions taken by users, service 
accounts, and Google services, including data access, configuration changes, and authentication events.

To view audit logs in Google Cloud, you can use the following steps:

- Open the Cloud Console and select the project that you want to view audit logs for.
- Go to the Logs Viewer page by selecting "Logging" from the left-hand menu.
- In the search bar, type the name of the log that you want to view (e.g., activity, data_access, system_event).
- Apply any filters that you want to use to refine your search (e.g., date range, resource type).
- Review the logs that are returned by the search. You can expand individual log entries to see additional details, 
  including the user or service account that performed the action, the IP address that was used, and the time the 
  action occurred.

In addition to using the Logs Viewer, you can also export audit logs to Google Cloud Storage or BigQuery for 
analysis and long-term retention. To do so, you can use the Cloud Logging API or the Cloud Console UI.
