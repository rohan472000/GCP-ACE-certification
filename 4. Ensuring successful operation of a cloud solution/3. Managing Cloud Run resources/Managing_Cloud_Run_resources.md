Managing Cloud Run resources involves adjusting application traffic-splitting parameters, 
setting scaling parameters for autoscaling instances, and determining whether to run Cloud Run 
(fully managed) or Cloud Run for Anthos.

To adjust application traffic-splitting parameters, you can use the gcloud command-line tool with the services update 
command. For example, the following command sets the traffic percentage to 70 for a Cloud Run service:
````
gcloud run services update SERVICE_NAME --traffic-split=70
````

To set scaling parameters for autoscaling instances, you can use the gcloud command-line tool with the services update 
command. For example, the following command sets the minimum number of instances to 2 and the maximum number of 
instances to 10 for a Cloud Run service:

```
gcloud run services update SERVICE_NAME --min-instances=2 --max-instances=10

```

When it comes to determining whether to run Cloud Run (fully managed) or Cloud Run for Anthos, the choice depends on 
whether you want to deploy to a fully managed serverless environment or use your own Kubernetes cluster. 
Cloud Run (fully managed) is a serverless platform that automatically scales your containers and manages the 
underlying infrastructure, while Cloud Run for Anthos allows you to deploy to your own Kubernetes cluster.

To deploy to Cloud Run (fully managed), you can use the gcloud command-line tool with the deploy command. For example, 
the following command deploys a container image to a Cloud Run service:

```
gcloud run deploy SERVICE_NAME --image=IMAGE_URL

```

To deploy to Cloud Run for Anthos, you can use the kubectl command-line tool with the apply command. For example, 
the following command deploys a YAML file to a Kubernetes cluster:

````
kubectl apply -f FILE.yaml
````
