1. Viewing current running cluster inventory (nodes, pods, services):

To view the current running inventory of a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the kubectl command-line tool. 
For example, to view all the nodes in a cluster, you can run the command `kubectl get nodes`. 
To view all the pods running in a cluster, you can run the command `kubectl get pods`. To view all the services 
running in a cluster, you can run the command `kubectl get services`.

2. Browsing Docker images and viewing their details in the Artifact Registry:

To browse Docker images and view their details in the Artifact Registry, you can use the gcloud command-line tool. 
For example, to list all the Docker images in the Artifact Registry, you can run the command `gcloud artifacts docker images list`.
To view the details of a specific Docker image, you can run the command `gcloud artifacts docker images describe <IMAGE_NAME>`.

3. Working with node pools (e.g., add, edit, or remove a node pool):

To work with node pools in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the gcloud command-line tool or the Google Cloud Console.
For example, to add a node pool to a cluster, you can run the command 
`gcloud container node-pools create <NODE_POOL_NAME> --cluster=<CLUSTER_NAME> --num-nodes=<NUM_NODES>`.
To edit a node pool, you can run the command 
`gcloud container node-pools update <NODE_POOL_NAME> --cluster=<CLUSTER_NAME> --num-nodes=<NEW_NUM_NODES>`. 
To remove a node pool, you can run the command `gcloud container node-pools delete <NODE_POOL_NAME> --cluster=<CLUSTER_NAME>`.

4. Working with pods (e.g., add, edit, or remove pods):

To work with pods in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the kubectl command-line tool. For example, to create a new pod, 
you can use a YAML file with the pod's configuration and run the command `kubectl apply -f <POD_CONFIG_FILE>`. 
To edit a pod's configuration, you can run the command `kubectl edit pod <POD_NAME>`. To delete a pod, you can run 
the command `kubectl delete pod <POD_NAME>`.

5. Working with services (e.g., add, edit, or remove a service):

To work with services in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the kubectl command-line tool. For example, to create a new 
service, you can use a YAML file with the service's configuration and run the command `kubectl apply -f <SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE>`.
To edit a service's configuration, you can run the command `kubectl edit service <SERVICE_NAME>`. To delete a service, 
you can run the command `kubectl delete service <SERVICE_NAME>`.

6. Working with stateful applications (e.g. persistent volumes, stateful sets):

To work with stateful applications in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the kubectl command-line tool. For example,
to create a new persistent volume, you can use a YAML file with the volume's configuration and run the command 
`kubectl apply -f <PERSISTENT_VOLUME_CONFIG_FILE>`. To create a new stateful set, you can use a YAML file with the 
set's configuration and run the command `kubectl apply -f <STATEFUL_SET_CONFIG_FILE>`.

7. Managing Horizontal and Vertical autoscaling configurations:

Horizontal autoscaling is the process of automatically increasing or decreasing the number of pods in a Kubernetes
cluster based on demand. Vertical autoscaling involves adjusting the resources allocated to a pod, such as CPU or 
memory, in response to changing workload requirements.

Example commands for horizontal autoscaling:

To set up a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for a deployment named my-deployment, with a target CPU utilization of 50% 
and a minimum of 1 pod and maximum of 10 pods:
```
kubectl autoscale deployment my-deployment --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=10

```

To view the current status of the HPA:
````
kubectl get hpa
````

Example commands for vertical autoscaling:

To set up a Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) for a deployment named my-deployment:

````
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler/hack/vpa-up/deployment-vpa.yaml
````

To view the current status of the VPA:

````
kubectl describe vpa my-deployment
````

8. Working with management interfaces (e.g., Google Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK, kubectl):

There are several management interfaces available for managing Kubernetes resources in Google Cloud. The Google 
Cloud Console is a web-based graphical user interface that can be used to perform common tasks such as deploying and
managing Kubernetes clusters, viewing logs and metrics, and managing storage resources. Cloud Shell provides a 
command-line interface (CLI) for managing resources, and includes the gcloud and kubectl command-line tools 
pre-installed. Cloud SDK is a software development kit that includes the gcloud command-line tool, as well as other 
tools for working with Google Cloud.

Example commands for managing Kubernetes resources with kubectl:

To view the current running cluster inventory:
````
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
````

To create a deployment named my-deployment with a single container running the nginx image:
````
kubectl create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx
````

To view the logs for a pod named my-pod:
````
kubectl logs my-pod
````

To delete a deployment named my-deployment:
````
kubectl delete deployment my-deployment
````
