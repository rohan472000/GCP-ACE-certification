1. Managing and securing objects in and between Cloud Storage buckets: This task involves managing objects in Cloud Storage, including creating, updating, and deleting objects, as well as configuring access control and permissions. Some relevant commands are:
- `gsutil cp`: Copy files to or from a Cloud Storage bucket
- `gsutil mv`: Move or rename files in a Cloud Storage bucket
- `gsutil rm`: Delete files from a Cloud Storage bucket
- `gsutil acl`: Set object-level access control for files in a Cloud Storage bucket

2. Setting object life cycle management policies for Cloud Storage buckets: This task involves setting policies that automatically delete or archive objects in a Cloud Storage bucket based on specified criteria, such as age or size. Some relevant commands are:
- `gsutil lifecycle set`: Set a life cycle policy for a Cloud Storage bucket
- `gsutil lifecycle get`: Get the current life cycle policy for a Cloud Storage bucket
- `gsutil lifecycle rm`: Remove the life cycle policy from a Cloud Storage bucket

3. Executing queries to retrieve data from data instances: This task involves querying data instances to retrieve data, such as running SQL queries on Cloud SQL databases or querying data from BigQuery tables. Some relevant commands are:
- `gcloud sql connect`: Connect to a Cloud SQL instance and run SQL queries
- `bq query`: Run a BigQuery SQL query from the command line
- `gcloud spanner databases execute-sql`: Execute a SQL query against a Cloud Spanner database

4. Estimating costs of data storage resources: This task involves estimating the costs of storing data in various data storage solutions, such as Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery. Some relevant commands are:
- `gcloud sql instances describe`: Get information about a Cloud SQL instance, including its pricing tier
- `gcloud storage cost`: Estimate the cost of storing data in a Cloud Storage bucket
- `bq show`: Get information about a BigQuery table, including its size and estimated cost

5. Backing up and restoring database instances: This task involves backing up and restoring database instances in various data storage solutions, such as Cloud SQL and Datastore. Some relevant commands are:
- `gcloud sql backups create`: Create a backup of a Cloud SQL instance
- `gcloud sql backups restore`: Restore a Cloud SQL instance from a backup
- `gcloud datastore export`: Export data from a Datastore database to a Cloud Storage bucket
- `gcloud datastore import`: Import data into a Datastore database from a Cloud Storage bucket

6. Reviewing job status in Dataproc, Dataflow, or BigQuery: This task involves reviewing the status of various data processing jobs in Google Cloud, such as Dataproc jobs, Dataflow jobs, or BigQuery queries. Some relevant commands are:
- `gcloud dataproc jobs list`: List the currently running Dataproc jobs
- `gcloud dataflow jobs list`: List the currently running Dataflow jobs
- `bq ls -j`: List the currently running BigQuery jobs
