Implementing resources via infrastructure as code (IaC) is a best practice for deploying and managing cloud resources. 
Google Cloud provides several tools for implementing IaC, including the Cloud Foundation Toolkit and Config Connector.

1. **Cloud Foundation Toolkit:** The Cloud Foundation Toolkit is an open-source project that provides a set of templates, 
   modules, and scripts for implementing cloud infrastructure as code on Google Cloud. The toolkit includes support for
   Terraform, Deployment Manager, and Google Cloud Build. It also includes modules for common infrastructure patterns, 
   such as VPCs, subnets, and IAM policies.

To use the Cloud Foundation Toolkit, you first need to set up a development environment with the required tools, such 
as Terraform and Google Cloud SDK. Then, you can create a new project and configure the toolkit to deploy infrastructure 
to that project. You can use the provided modules as a starting point and customize them as needed for your specific use
case.

2. **Config Connector:** Config Connector is a Kubernetes add-on that enables you to manage Google Cloud resources using 
   Kubernetes manifests. With Config Connector, you can create, update, and delete resources such as Compute Engine 
   instances, Cloud Storage buckets, and Cloud SQL databases, using familiar Kubernetes syntax and tooling.

To use Config Connector, you need to first set up a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster and configure Config Connector to 
run as a Kubernetes deployment. Then, you can define custom resources in Kubernetes manifests, using the Config Connector
CRDs (custom resource definitions). 
You can use the kubectl command-line tool to apply these manifests and create or update Google Cloud resources.

Here are some commands that you might find useful:

To install the Cloud Foundation Toolkit:

    ```
    # Install Terraform
    curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
    
    # Install gcloud SDK
    curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
    
    # Install the Cloud Foundation Toolkit
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit.git
    cd cloud-foundation-toolkit/terraform
    
    # Initialize the project
    terraform init
    
    ```

To deploy a Cloud Foundation Toolkit module:

    ```
    # Set the project and region
    gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]
    gcloud config set compute/region [REGION]
    
    # Create a Terraform workspace
    terraform workspace new [WORKSPACE_NAME]
    
    # Apply the module
    terraform apply -var-file=[VARIABLES_FILE]
    ```

To install Config Connector:

    ```
    # Create a new GKE cluster
    gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] \
        --zone [ZONE] \
        --enable-stackdriver-kubernetes
    
    # Install Config Connector
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/config-connector/releases/latest/download/release.yaml
    
    ```

To create a Cloud SQL instance using Config Connector:

    ```
    # Define the Cloud SQL instance manifest
    cat <<EOF > cloudsql.yaml
    apiVersion: sql.cnrm.cloud.google.com/v1beta1
    kind: SQLInstance
    metadata:
      name: [INSTANCE_NAME]
    spec:
      region: [REGION]
      databaseVersion: POSTGRES_13
      settings:
        tier: db-f1-micro
        ipConfiguration:
          ipv4Enabled: true
    EOF
    
    # Apply the manifest
    kubectl apply -f cloudsql.yaml
    ```
