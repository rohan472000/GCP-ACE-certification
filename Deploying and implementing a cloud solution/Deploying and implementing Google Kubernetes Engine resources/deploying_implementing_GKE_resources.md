To deploy and implement Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) resources, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure the command line interface (CLI) for Kubernetes (kubectl):

- Download and install the Cloud SDK (if not already installed).
- Run the command `gcloud components install kubectl` to install kubectl.
`
2. Deploy a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster with different configurations:

- Run the command `gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME]` to create a standard cluster
- Run the command `gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --enable-autopilot` to create an Autopilot cluster
- Run the command `gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --region [REGION]` to create a regional cluster
- Run the command `gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --private-cluster` to create a private cluster

3. Deploy a containerized application to Google Kubernetes Engine:

- Create a Kubernetes deployment configuration file that specifies the container image and deployment settings
- Run the command `kubectl apply -f [DEPLOYMENT_FILE]` to deploy the application

4. Configure Google Kubernetes Engine monitoring and logging:

- Enable monitoring and logging for your cluster by running the command 
  `gcloud container clusters update [CLUSTER_NAME] --enable-stackdriver-kubernetes`
- Use the Cloud Console or Cloud Monitoring API to view monitoring and logging data for your cluster


By following these steps, you can deploy and implement Google Kubernetes Engine resources with different configurations 
and deploy containerized applications to the cluster. Additionally, you can configure monitoring and logging to monitor
the health and performance of your applications running in the cluster.
