1. Creating Cloud Monitoring alerts based on resource metrics:

You can create alerts in Cloud Monitoring to notify you when certain resource metrics fall outside of specified 
thresholds. These alerts can be sent via email, SMS, or can trigger a webhook. You can also use Cloud Monitoring to 
set up dashboards to visualize metrics and gain insights into the performance of your resources.
Here are some commands for creating an alert policy:
```
gcloud alpha monitoring policies create --policy-from-file= \[PATH_TO_POLICY_FILE]
```

2. Creating and ingesting Cloud Monitoring custom metrics:

Cloud Monitoring provides a mechanism to ingest custom metrics that you define, allowing you to track specific 
application or infrastructure metrics that are important to your business. You can use the Monitoring API to submit 
custom metrics.
Here's an example command to submit a custom metric:
```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @custom_metric.json \
"https://monitoring.googleapis.com/v3/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/metricDescriptors"
```

3. Configuring log sinks to export logs to external systems:

You can export logs from Cloud Logging to external systems such as Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Pub/Sub. 
To do this, you can create a log sink and specify the destination for the logs.
Here's an example command to create a log sink that exports logs to Google Cloud Storage:
```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] \
destination="[DESTINATION_URI]" \
--log-filter="[LOG_FILTER]"
```

4. Configuring log routers:

You can use log routers to route logs to specific destinations based on certain criteria. For example, 
you could route logs from certain compute instances to a specific Cloud Storage bucket.
Here's an example command to create a log router:
```
gcloud beta logging routers create [ROUTER_NAME] \
--destination=[DESTINATION_URI] \
--filter=[LOG_FILTER]
```

5. Viewing and filtering logs in Cloud Logging:

Cloud Logging provides a web interface and command-line tools for viewing and filtering logs. You can filter logs 
based on various criteria such as time range, log level, log name, or custom fields.
Here's an example command to view logs in the command-line interface:
```
gcloud logging read "resource.type=global" --project=[PROJECT_ID]
```

6. Viewing specific log message details in Cloud Logging:

You can drill down into specific log messages in Cloud Logging to view additional details such as log metadata and 
trace information. You can also use Cloud Trace to view trace information for specific requests.
Here's an example command to view a log entry in Cloud Logging:
```
gcloud logging read "resource.type=global" "jsonPayload.message:[LOG_MESSAGE]" --project=[PROJECT_ID]
```

7. Using cloud diagnostics to research an application issue:

Google Cloud provides various tools for diagnosing and troubleshooting application issues. For example, 
you can use Cloud Trace to view traces for specific requests, or use Cloud Debug to debug a running application.
Here's an example command to start a debug session:
```
gcloud debug app [SERVICE_NAME] --project=[PROJECT_ID]
```

8. Viewing Google Cloud status:

You can view the current status of Google Cloud services by visiting the Google Cloud Status Dashboard. 
The dashboard provides real-time updates on the status of various services and regions.
