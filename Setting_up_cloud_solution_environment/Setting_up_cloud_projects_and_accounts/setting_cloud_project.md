1. Creating a resource hierarchy:

The resource hierarchy in GCP allows you to group resources by organization, folder, project, and resource. 
This helps to manage access control and policies across different resources. To create a resource hierarchy, follow these steps:

- Create an organization: An organization is the highest level of the resource hierarchy in GCP. You can create an organization using the Google Cloud Console or the Cloud Identity and Access Management API.
- Create folders: You can create folders within the organization to group projects and resources. Folders can be created using the Google Cloud Console or the Cloud Resource Manager API.
- Create projects: Projects are containers for resources in GCP. You can create projects using the Google Cloud Console or the Cloud Resource Manager API.



2. Applying organizational policies to the resource hierarchy:

Organizational policies in GCP help enforce governance and compliance requirements for resources within the organization. 
Policies can be applied to the entire organization, specific folders, or individual projects. 
Here's an example command to create an organization policy:

```
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding [ORGANIZATION_ID] --member='group:[GROUP_EMAIL_ADDRESS]' --role='roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin'
```


3. Granting members IAM roles within a project:

IAM roles in GCP define the permissions granted to members for accessing resources within a project. Members can be users, groups, or service accounts.
To grant IAM roles to members, use the following command:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member='user:[USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS]' --role='roles/viewer'
```


4. Managing users and groups in Cloud Identity (manually and automated):

Cloud Identity is a service that provides identity and access management for GCP resources. You can manage users and groups manually 
through the Cloud Identity and Access Management console, or programmatically using the Cloud Identity API. 
Here's an example command to add a user to a group:

```
gcloud alpha identity groups memberships add [GROUP_NAME] --member-email [USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS]
```


5. Enabling APIs within projects:

To use a GCP service or resource, you need to enable the corresponding API for the project. 
You can do this through the Google Cloud Console or using the Cloud SDK. 
Here's an example command to enable the Compute Engine API for a project:

```
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com --project [PROJECT_ID]
```


6. Provisioning and setting up products in Google Cloud's operations suite:

Google Cloud's operations suite provides monitoring, logging, and performance management tools for GCP resources. 
You can provision and set up these products using the Google Cloud Console or the Cloud SDK. 
Here's an example command to create a Cloud Logging sink that exports logs to Cloud Storage:

```
gcloud logging sinks create [SINK_NAME] storage.googleapis.com/[BUCKET_NAME] --project [PROJECT_ID] --include-children --log-filter='[LOG_FILTER]'
```
